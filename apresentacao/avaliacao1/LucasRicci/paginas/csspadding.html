  <h2>CSS Padding</h2>
  <p>The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, 
  inside of any defined borders. </p>

  <p>With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).</p>
